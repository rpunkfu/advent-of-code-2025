# Advent of Code 2025 - Day 1: Secret Entrance

## Problem

A safe at the North Pole entrance has a dial numbered 0-99. You're given a sequence of rotations (`L` for left, `R` for right) with distances, starting from position 50.

**Part 1:** Count how many times the dial points at 0 **after** completing a rotation.

**Part 2:** Count how many times the dial points at 0 **during or after** any rotation (every click that lands on 0 counts).

## Solution Approach

### Part 1
Simple simulation — apply each rotation using modular arithmetic and check if the final position is 0.

### Part 2
Instead of simulating every click (which would be O(n) per rotation), we calculate zero crossings mathematically in O(1):

- **Going right:** `position / 100` gives the number of times we wrapped past 100 (which equals 0)
- **Going left:** If the new position ≤ 0, we crossed zero. The count is `|position| / 100 + 1`, unless we started at 0 (then it's `|position| / 100` since leaving 0 doesn't count as crossing it)

## Complexity

- **Part 1:** O(n) where n = number of rotations
- **Part 2:** O(n) where n = number of rotations (not total clicks)
