# Advent of Code 2025 - Day 6: Trash Compactor

## Problem

A cephalopod's math worksheet contains arithmetic problems arranged in columns. Each problem has numbers stacked vertically with an operator (`+` or `*`) at the bottom.

**Part 1:** Read numbers horizontally (left-to-right) within each row. Problems are separated by space-only columns.

**Part 2:** Read numbers vertically — each column is a single number with digits top-to-bottom (most significant first). Problems are still separated by space-only columns.

## Solution Approach

### Part 1
Parse each row by splitting on whitespace. Track numbers by column index, accumulating operands until an operator is encountered.

### Part 2
Transpose the grid (swap rows ↔ columns), then iterate through columns:
- Space-only columns act as problem separators
- Each non-space column contributes one number (digits read top-to-bottom)
- The operator character determines the operation

```rust
let transposed: Vec<Vec<char>> = (0..width)
    .map(|col| (0..height).map(|row| lines[row].get(col).copied().unwrap_or(' ')).collect())
    .collect();
```

## Running

```bash
cargo run
```

Input file should be placed at `.fixtures/input.txt`.

## Complexity

- **Part 1:** O(n) where n = total characters in input
- **Part 2:** O(w × h) for transposition + O(w) for parsing, where w = width, h = height
