# Advent of Code 2025 - Day 2: Gift Shop

## Problem

The North Pole gift shop database has been corrupted with invalid product IDs. Given ranges of IDs, find the invalid ones based on repeating digit patterns.

**Part 1:** An ID is invalid if it's made of some sequence of digits repeated **exactly twice** (e.g., `55`, `6464`, `123123`).

**Part 2:** An ID is invalid if it's made of some sequence of digits repeated **at least twice** (e.g., `111`, `1212121212`, `123123123`).

## Solution Approach

### Part 1
Check if the number has even length and the first half equals the second half.

### Part 2
For each possible pattern length `i` from 1 to `len/2`, check if the number is evenly divisible into chunks of size `i` and all chunks equal the first chunk.

```rust
(1..=len / 2)
    .filter(|&i| len % i == 0)
    .any(|i| bytes.chunks(i).all(|chunk| chunk == &bytes[..i]))
```

## Complexity

- **Part 1:** O(n × d) where n = total numbers in ranges, d = digits per number
- **Part 2:** O(n × d²) due to checking all divisor pattern lengths
