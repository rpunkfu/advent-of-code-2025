## Problem

Emergency batteries are needed to power an escalator. Each line of input represents a bank of batteries, with digits 1-9 indicating joltage ratings. You must select batteries to maximize the joltage output (formed by concatenating the selected digits in order).

**Part 1:** Select exactly **2 batteries** from each bank to form the largest 2-digit joltage.

**Part 2:** Select exactly **12 batteries** from each bank to form the largest 12-digit joltage.

## Solution Approach

### Part 1 & Part 2
Uses a `Bank` structure that buffers all digits from a line, then calculates the result:

- **Buffer phase:** Store every digit encountered in a fixed-size buffer
- **Calculate phase:** For each buffered digit, determine which state positions it could still affect based on remaining digits, then update positions where the new digit is larger

The algorithm processes digits in order and maintains a sliding window of which positions in the final number can still be improved by upcoming digits.

```rust
for state_digit in state.iter_mut().take(self.length).skip(state_start_idx) {
    if digit > *state_digit {
        *state_digit = digit;
        found = true;
    }
}
```

## Complexity

- **Part 1:** O(n) where n = number of lines
- **Part 2:** O(n) where n = number of lines

Since the buffer size (256) and bank size (12) are fixed constants, per-line processing is O(1).
